# Weather App via OpenWeatherMap API

This project has design and developed to learn how to use Express JS, Express-Handlebars JS. I have combined my front-end and back-end skills on this project by fetching the data from OpenWeatherMap.org API key.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
